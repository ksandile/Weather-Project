# Weather Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing weather data to derive meaningful insights such as temperature trends, precipitation, humidity, and wind patterns.

## Dataset Overview

- The dataset includes various meteorological attributes, such as:
  - **Temperature**: Daily, monthly, and yearly temperature data.
  - **Precipitation**: Rainfall or snow records.
  - **Humidity**: Data on daily average humidity levels.
  - **Wind Speed**: Measurements of wind speed.
  - **Other Factors**: Cloud cover, UV index, and more.

## Key Insights

1. **Temperature Trends**:
   - The analysis reveals patterns in daily, monthly, and yearly temperatures.
   - Seasonal variations and heatwaves are highlighted.

2. **Precipitation**:
   - Rainy seasons are identified, along with monthly average precipitation data.
   - Extreme weather conditions such as floods or droughts are analyzed.

3. **Humidity Levels**:
   - Insights into how humidity varies by season and its impact on the comfort index.

4. **Wind Speed**:
   - Identifies areas and periods of high wind speeds, including storms or calm periods.

## Data Visualizations

- Various plots were created to visualize weather patterns, including:
  - **Temperature vs. Time** (Daily, Monthly, Yearly).
  - **Precipitation Patterns** over time.
  - **Humidity Trends** and its impact on perceived temperature.
  - **Wind Speed** distribution.

## Tools Used

- **Python Libraries**:
  - pandas (for data manipulation)
  - matplotlib (for plotting temperature trends)
  - seaborn (for statistical visualizations)
  - scikit-learn (for predictive modeling, if applicable)

## Conclusion

The weather analysis helps in understanding climate patterns, which is essential for agriculture, disaster preparedness, and urban planning.
